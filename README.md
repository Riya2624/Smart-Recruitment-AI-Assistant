The **LLaMA-Powered Recruitment Assistant** is an AI-driven tool designed to optimize the recruitment process. Leveraging the **LLaMA model**, LangChain, and ChatGroq, this system extracts key details such as job roles, required skills, and experience levels from job descriptions. It integrates **ChromaDB** for semantic portfolio matching and real-time feedback, while an interactive **Streamlit** interface provides seamless functionality for job input, portfolio matching, and automated email generation.  

## **Features**  
1. **Job Description Analysis**:  
   Extracts structured data, such as job roles, skills, and experience levels, from unstructured job descriptions using the LLaMA model and LangChain.  

2. **Semantic Portfolio Matching**:  
   Utilizes **ChromaDB** for efficient vector-based semantic search, matching candidate portfolios based on job requirements.  

3. **Interactive Web Interface**:  
   Built using **Streamlit**, the interface allows recruiters to input job descriptions, view matching portfolios, and manage candidate communication.  

4. **Automated Email Generation**:  
   Employs **ChatGroq** for generating contextually personalized emails to communicate with shortlisted candidates or stakeholders.  

5. **Real-Time Feedback**:  
   Provides dynamic portfolio matching and instant feedback, enabling faster recruitment decisions.
